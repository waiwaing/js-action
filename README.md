## Usage

Here's an example of how to use this action in a workflow file:

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      who-to-greet:
        description: Who to greet in the log
        required: true
        default: 'World'
        type: string

jobs:
  say-hello:
    name: Say Hello
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Change @main to a specific commit SHA or version tag, e.g.:
      # actions/hello-world-javascript-action@e76147da8e5c81eaf017dede5645551d4b94427b
      # actions/hello-world-javascript-action@v1.2.3
      - name: Print to Log
        id: print-to-log
        uses: actions/hello-world-javascript-action@main
        with:
          who-to-greet: ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}
```

## Dependency License Management

This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow,
[`licensed.yml`](./.github/workflows/licensed.yml), that uses
[Licensed](https://github.com/licensee/licensed) to check for dependencies with
missing or non-compliant licenses. This workflow is initially disabled. To
enable the workflow, follow the below steps.

1. Open [`licensed.yml`](./.github/workflows/licensed.yml)
1. Uncomment the following lines:

   ```yaml
   # pull_request:
   #   branches:
   #     - main
   # push:
   #   branches:
   #     - main
   ```

1. Save and commit the changes

Once complete, this workflow will run any time a pull request is created or
changes pushed directly to `main`. If the workflow detects any dependencies with
missing or non-compliant licenses, it will fail the workflow and provide details
on the issue(s) found.

### Updating Licenses

Whenever you install or update dependencies, you can use the Licensed CLI to
update the licenses database. To install Licensed, see the project's
[Readme](https://github.com/licensee/licensed?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

To update the cached licenses, run the following command:

```bash
licensed cache
```

To check the status of cached licenses, run the following command:

```bash
licensed status
```
